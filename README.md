I am not worried about ui right now and don't put too much effort into developing as its just a test task so please keep that in mind, though i made some responsiveness adjustments.

What im interested in is separating concept for file structure and reusability alongside with performance.

Thats why on pokedex page you would see me using a hack on retrieving the images by an id but not from the response but directly. Thats because their api doesn't allow us to access that info directly and i don't want to have tons of requests firing because i need that little piece of info.

But ideally we would have that info coming from response and there would be no need to use such solutions.
