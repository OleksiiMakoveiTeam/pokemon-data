Pokémon Test Task
This project is a simple Pokédex application built as part of a test task. It allows users to browse Pokémon, view their details, and explore their evolution chains. The focus of this implementation is on file structure, reusability, and performance, while keeping the solution simple and aligned with the requirements.

Key Features
Pokémon List: Browse Pokémon with pagination.

Pokémon Details: View detailed information about a Pokémon, including its height, weight, types, and evolution chain.

Evolution Chain: Explore the evolution chain of a Pokémon.

Responsive Design: Basic responsiveness adjustments for a better user experience across devices.

Technical Highlights
File Structure
The project follows a modular and scalable file structure to ensure reusability and maintainability:

src/
├── components/ # Reusable UI components (e.g., PokemonImage, PokemonType)
|── \_\_generated/ # Autogenerated code from openapi source
|── @types/ # Some type declarations, such as i18n
├── store/ # Redux store and slices for state management
├── utils/ # Utility functions (e.g., calculateHeight, calculateWeight)
├── pages/ # Application pages (e.g., Pokedex, SinglePokemon)
├── hooks/ # Custom hooks
├── assets/ # Static assets (e.g., images, styles)
|── components/ # For reusability
|── i18n/ # For international translations just a basic setup
|── layouts/ # Generally same as providers but for layout contexts
|── providers/ # Contexts to wrap app
|── test/ # Some utility stuff which help tests
|── theme/ # For MUI style overwrite
└── App.tsx # Main application component

Reusability
Components: UI components like PokemonImage, PokemonType, and PokemonDescription are designed to be reusable across the application.

API Layer: The pokemonApi service encapsulates all API calls, making it easy to manage and reuse API logic.

Utility Functions: Functions like calculateHeight and calculateWeight are abstracted into utilities for reuse.

Performance Optimizations
Image Fetching Hack: To avoid excessive API requests, Pokémon images are retrieved directly by ID instead of fetching them from the API response. This reduces the number of requests and improves performance.

Trade-off: Ideally, the API response would include image URLs, eliminating the need for this workaround.

Pagination: The Pokémon list uses pagination to load data in chunks, reducing initial load time and improving performance.

UI/UX
The UI is functional but could be further polished with animations, better loading states, and a more refined design.
Accessibility improvements (e.g., ARIA labels, keyboard navigation) could be added.

Testing
The project includes basic unit tests for utility functions and API endpoints. However, test coverage could be expanded to include:

More component tests for UI elements.
Integration tests for user flows (e.g., navigating between pages).
