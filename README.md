# Pokémon Test Task

This project is a simple Pokédex application built as part of a test task. It allows users to browse Pokémon, view their details, and explore their evolution chains. The focus of this implementation is on **file structure**, **reusability**, and **performance**, while keeping the solution simple and aligned with the requirements.

---

## Key Features

- **Pokémon List**: Browse Pokémon with pagination.
- **Pokémon Details**: View detailed information about a Pokémon, including its height, weight, types, and evolution chain.
- **Evolution Chain**: Explore the evolution chain of a Pokémon.
- **Responsive Design**: Basic responsiveness adjustments for a better user experience across devices.

## Technical Highlights

### File Structure
The project follows a modular and scalable file structure to ensure reusability and maintainability:
```
src/
├── components/ # Reusable UI components (e.g., PokemonImage, PokemonType)
├── __generated/ # Autogenerated code from openapi source
├── @types/ # Some type declarations, such as i18n
├── store/ # Redux store and slices for state management
├── utils/ # Utility functions (e.g., calculateHeight, calculateWeight)
├── pages/ # Application pages (e.g., Pokedex, SinglePokemon)
├── hooks/ # Custom hooks
├── assets/ # Static assets (e.g., images, styles)
├── i18n/ # For international translations (basic setup)
├── layouts/ # Generally same as providers but for layout contexts
├── providers/ # Contexts to wrap app
├── test/ # Some utility stuff to help tests
├── theme/ # For MUI style overwrite
└── App.tsx # Main application component
```

### Reusability
- **Components**: UI components like `PokemonImage`, `PokemonType`, and `PokemonDescription` are designed to be reusable across the application.
- **API Layer**: The `pokemonApi` service encapsulates all API calls, making it easy to manage and reuse API logic.
- **Utility Functions**: Functions like `calculateHeight` and `calculateWeight` are abstracted into utilities for reuse.

### Performance Optimizations
- **Image Fetching Hack**: To avoid excessive API requests, Pokémon images are retrieved directly by ID instead of fetching them from the API response. This reduces the number of requests and improves performance.
  - **Trade-off**: Ideally, the API response would include image URLs, eliminating the need for this workaround.
- **Pagination**: The Pokémon list uses pagination to load data in chunks, reducing initial load time and improving performance.

## UI/UX
The UI is functional but could be further polished with animations, better loading states, and a more refined design. Accessibility improvements (e.g., ARIA labels, keyboard navigation) could be added.

---

## Testing
The project includes basic unit tests for utility functions and API endpoints. However, test coverage could be expanded to include:
- More component tests for UI elements.
- Integration tests for user flows (e.g., navigating between pages).
